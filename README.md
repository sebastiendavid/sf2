Our developers are the best at Street Fighter, here is our high score page:

https://alkemics.github.io/sf2/

To apply, please email `steve@alkemics.com` with "**Hire me, I'm the best at Street Fighter**" as the subject, and include a link to our high scores page in the body, and hopefully a link that leads to our page where you are the one being the best!

To be clear, solving this puzzle involves finding a way to trick our high score page buggy code and put your name on top of the list. The body of your email should look something like this:

```
I'm the best at Street Fighter! For proof, see:

https://alkemics.github.io/sf2/…something…

But I prefer to play to Dark Souls…

Anyway, …the rest of your cover letter, if you have more to tell us…
```
